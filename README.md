# 📊 Student Grades Dashboard

This project was developed as a hands-on practice exercise in data analysis using Python and Streamlit.

The goal was to explore a student grades dataset, apply key performance indicators (KPIs), and visualize relevant insights for educational institutions.

### ✨ Analysis performed

- Overall average grade
- Average grade by subject and term
- Grade distribution (boxplots and histograms)
- Pass rate by subject
- Student grade progression over time
- Student ranking (Top 3 / Bottom 3)
- Identification of students at academic risk (average grade < 6)
- Identification of easiest and hardest subjects

### ⚙️ Tools used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- Streamlit (for interactive visualization)
- CSV file as data source

This project served as a personal practice opportunity to strengthen skills in data processing, visualization, and actionable insight generation.
